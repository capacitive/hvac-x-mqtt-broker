## Build Journal: HVACX Broker on Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W (Buildroot)

Principle: We proceed in lock step. Each step has a clear objective, procedure, and verification. We do not advance until the step is verified.

### Journal Process Guidelines
- Always include assistant responses verbatim in the journal by default for every conversation, unless the user requests otherwise.
- Proceed in lock step: each step has Objective, Procedure, Verification; do not advance until verified.
- Record all Q&A exchanges at each checkpoint, quoting user and assistant verbatim.



### Session Preamble and User Prompt (Recorded)

- User Prompt (verbatim):
  "OK - let's read the BUILDROOT doc and plan each minute step in detail.  For embedded/microcontroller/linux kernel/low level programming projects:
  Start with a document that serves as a journal of everything we do in lock step.  We can't move on to the next step until the first is successful and tested.  For an embedded device project, this is a very important approach to remember to do before working on items.  It's easy to get stuck down one course of action, so a detailed journal is vital to our success.

  I'd like you to start with a brief technical explanation of each work item, accompanied by an ELIM5 explanation.

  First - let's explain and then work on the most basic "Hello World" - a bare bones kernel that (pick the most possible/easiest/best for step by step buildup from basic to complex):
  OPTION 1: Boots into an environment with a userspace that allows me to use the `pwd` command to determine the user the bare OS is running under.
  OPTION 2: Boots into  a "userless" environment that prints hello to the screen and than continues the OS runloop.
  OPTION 3 (likely the most scaled down of them all, therefore much desired for a hello world): A root-only user environment that can run anything it needs (but only gets access to what it's needed to do - principle of minimal computing/contraints)"

- Assistant Preamble (verbatim):
  Great—let’s kick this off methodically with a lock-step journal and clear choices.

  Option analysis with brief technical and ELIM5 explanations
- Procedure (implemented):
  - Create tardigrade/ orchestration with build-image.sh
  - Scaffold Buildroot external tree at br/external with overlay and post-build hook
  - Add Makefile targets: tardigrade-image, tardigrade-flash
  - Use raspberrypi3_defconfig as base, override DTS to bcm2710-rpi-zero-2-w and add overlay
- Expected output: .buildroot/output/images/sdcard.img
- Current status: Building image (first build may take 20–60 minutes). I’ll prompt when it’s time to flash.

### Step 1 Verification Outcome (User Test Report)
- User report: Boot sequence healthy; keyboard/mouse hotplug events printed to console.
- Observation: Hello message not visible.
- Action taken: Updated S99hello to:
  - log via `logger -t tartigrade` (if syslogd is active)
  - wait briefly for `/dev/tty1` and write directly to it
  - append message to `/etc/motd` to be visible at login
- Next verification: Reboot and confirm:
  - Message appears on console (tty1)
  - Message present in `/etc/motd`
- Result: Build and flash successful (user report).

  - If syslog present, `logread | grep tartigrade` shows the entry

### Flashing: Auto-Expand to Full Device Capacity
- Requirement: Use entire device capacity (e.g., 128GB) instead of fixed ~34GB rootfs
- Action taken (host-side, in `scripts/flash.sh`):
  - After dd + sync, run `partprobe` and `parted` to resize partition 2 to 100%
  - Run `e2fsck -f -p` and `resize2fs` on rootfs partition to expand filesystem
- Notes:
  - Handles `/dev/sdX2` and `/dev/mmcblk0p2` naming schemes
  - Requires `parted`, `e2fsck` and `resize2fs` on the host; skips gracefully if missing

### Repository hygiene: Buildroot as submodule
- Action: Registered .buildroot as a git submodule using its existing remote URL (https://gitlab.com/buildroot.org/buildroot.git).
- Rationale: Makes the Buildroot tree explicit, reproducible, and easy to update via standard submodule flows.
- Script safeguard: Updated tardigrade/build-image.sh to detect a git work tree (covers submodules where .git is a file) and skip re-cloning.
- Next steps: Commit with an appropriate message when ready (we have not committed on your behalf).

- Next verification:

### Checkpoint: Rename execution (tartigrade → tardigrade)
- Action: Renamed directory via git mv tartigrade → tardigrade.
- Updated files:
  - Makefile targets and help: tardigrade-image, tardigrade-flash; path: bash tardigrade/build-image.sh
  - tardigrade/build-image.sh: log prefixes updated to [tardigrade]
  - br/external/overlay/etc/init.d/S99hello: message, logger tag, and header updated to tardigrade
  - br/external/board/hvacx/rpi0_2w/post-build.sh: banner updated to “tardigrade Step 1 (Hello World)”
  - br/external/external.desc and external.mk: updated descriptions to tardigrade
- Journal policy: Prior quotes remain verbatim (so earlier occurrences of “tartigrade” in Q&A/logs are preserved); going forward we use “tardigrade”.
- Build verification: Ran `make tardigrade-image`.
  - Result: Success. Image generated at .buildroot/output/images/sdcard.img
  - Notes:
    - Warnings: kconfig override warnings for BR2_ROOTFS_OVERLAY/POST_BUILD_SCRIPT/DTB (expected; we append overrides).
    - mke2fs note: 64-bit ext4 feature disabled by design (Buildroot default for small images); harmless.
    - Missing path during cleanup (usr/libexec) printed by find is benign.

- Next verification: make tardigrade-image; make tardigrade-flash

  - After flashing, run `lsblk` to confirm rootfs partition uses full capacity

### Checkpoint: Phase 1 (augment-deploy-tiny) initialized
- Branch: augment-deploy-tiny
- Changes staged (no commit yet):
  - Toolchain: switch to musl via build overrides (BR2_TOOLCHAIN_BUILDROOT + BR2_TOOLCHAIN_BUILDROOT_MUSL)
  - Quiet boot: custom post-image script to remove serial console, add console=tty1, quiet, loglevel=3
  - Boot banner: S99hello prints "Linux <kernel> | tardigrade image <VER> | <OS>" before hello
  - Version embed: post-build writes /etc/tardigrade-version from repo VERSION (defaults v0.1.0 if absent)
  - Size reporting: scripts/size-report.sh (host) and /usr/sbin/tardigrade-size-report (device)
- Next actions:
  - Build locally (make tardigrade-image) and verify boot banner + quiet kernel
  - Flash and confirm hello still appears and device boots cleanly

### Checkpoint: Phase 1 tuning (kernel LZ4 + firmware tweaks)
- Kernel compression: enabled LZ4 via config fragment (faster decompress on Cortex-A53)
- Post-image tweaks:
  - cmdline.txt: add console=tty1 quiet loglevel=3 rootflags=noatime,nodiratime; remove serial console
  - config.txt: set boot_delay=0, disable_splash=1, gpu_mem=16
- Buildroot overrides appended in tardigrade/build-image.sh:
  - BR2_LINUX_KERNEL_CONFIG_FRAGMENT_FILES -> board/hvacx/rpi0_2w/kernel-lz4.fragment
  - BR2_PACKAGE_HOST_LZ4=y (ensure host lz4 available)
- Next: Rebuild (make tardigrade-image), flash, verify faster/cleaner boot and banner



### Checkpoint: Flash verification (host-side SD card)
- User report (verbatim):
  - "The boot of the device was successful, I see the hello message at the end of the boot sequence. I cannot use the keyboard to type any commands like `cat /etc/issue` (likely because there's no keyboard configured on our image), but that's ok for now."
- Assistant verification (host-side lsblk):
  - Detected device: sdc MassStorageClass usb RM=1 SIZE=115.9G
  - Partitions:
    - sdc1 32M vfat (boot)
    - sdc2 115.8G ext4 LABEL=rootfs (root filesystem)
  - Interpretation: Matches expected layout. Rootfs partition expanded to fill device capacity. Expansion successful.



  - Option 1: Minimal userspace with shell (pwd available)
    - Technical: Boot a tiny userspace (BusyBox) with an interactive shell on console. You can run pwd, ls, etc. This needs a working init and /sbin/getty for login.
    - ELIM5: We make a tiny computer that turns on and lets you type simple commands like “where am I?” It’s like turning on a calculator that also lets you see the folder you’re in.
  - Option 2: Kernel-only “hello” print and runloop
    - Technical: Modify kernel/initramfs to print “hello” and keep the scheduler running but provide no shell. Smallest, but not useful for later steps like Wi‑Fi/SSH without adding userspace back.
    - ELIM5: We turn on the brain and it says “hello,” but you can’t talk back to it yet. It’s very small, but we can’t do much with it.
  - Option 3: Root-only minimal userspace (BusyBox), prints hello, then continues
    - Technical: Boot BusyBox init, run a startup script that echoes “hello”, leave the shell available as root. No extra users, no sudo, minimal footprint. Easiest path to incrementally add Wi‑Fi/SSH later.
    - ELIM5: It turns on, says “hello,” and gives you the simplest set of tools so we can keep building without adding extra stuff.

  Recommendation
  - Choose Option 3 for Hello World. It’s minimal, yet it keeps the path open to add networking and SSH in small, safe steps.

  Journal created
  - I created docs/JOURNAL.md to log every step. We will not proceed to the next step until the current one is verified on real hardware.

  Next: Step 1 plan (Hello World — Option 3)
  - Objective: Boot to root-only BusyBox, print hello at boot, keep console usable.
  - What I will implement:
    - Buildroot external tree in br/external with:
      - hvacx_rpi0_2w_defconfig (Pi Zero 2 W, 32-bit ARMv7)
      - overlay/ with an init script that echoes “hello” at boot and continues
      - board/hvacx/rpi0_2w/post-build.sh (scaffold only for now)
    - Makefile targets:
      - br-init: fetch Buildroot into .buildroot (pinned)
      - build-armv7: compile your Go app (not used yet for Hello World, but scaffolding ready)
      - br-image: run Buildroot unattended with BR2_EXTERNAL to produce sdcard.img
      - br-flash: reuse existing flash script to write sdcard.img
  - Verification on hardware:
    - Boot device, see “hello” in boot log, get to console, run pwd to confirm userspace works.

### Step 0: Orientation and Goal Lock

### Q&A Log (Recorded after Step 1 build/flash)

- Q1 (User, verbatim):
  "Is this a C/C++ build?"

  - Assistant (verbatim):
    Short answer: The Buildroot step is primarily a C build (with optional C++), while your application is Go.

    Details
    - What’s building now: Buildroot is compiling upstream components (Linux kernel, BusyBox, toolchain, etc.) which are almost entirely C, with some packages optionally using C++. It uses GCC/G++ cross-compilers.
    - Your code: Our repo’s application code is Go (build targets are go build). For Step 1 we didn’t add any C/C++ source of our own; only a tiny shell init script to echo “hello.”

    Evidence from the repo
    - Go build targets (your app):
      build:
        go build -o $(BUILD_DIR)/$(APP_NAME) ./

      build-arm:
        CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux GOARCH=arm GOARM=6 go build -o $(BUILD_DIR)/$(APP_NAME) ./

    - Hello script (shell, not C/C++):
      #!/bin/sh
      echo "hello from tartigrade: minimal boot successful"
      exit 0

    - Buildroot uses C/C++ toolchains (CMake toolchain file references C/CXX compilers).

    Conclusion
    - The in-progress Buildroot pipeline is a C-first (and sometimes C++) build of the OS stack. Our own contribution for Step 1 is shell and configuration. Your broker remains a Go program; we’ll integrate its Go cross-build in a later step.

- Q2 (User, verbatim):
  "Where is the build running - my machine or remotely?  What can I do to see the progress of the build?"

  - Assistant (verbatim):
    Short answer
    - It’s running locally on your machine. The build script clones Buildroot into .buildroot inside your repo and runs make there.
    - To see progress, run the build in your own terminal (make tartigrade-image) to watch stdout, or monitor .buildroot/output/build to see which packages are being built in real time.

    Evidence from the repo
    - The tartigrade build runs in a local folder and invokes make locally:
      ROOT_DIR=... BR_DIR="$ROOT_DIR/.buildroot"; git clone ... "$BR_DIR"; make -C "$BR_DIR" -j"$JOBS"; IMG_PATH="$BR_DIR/output/images/sdcard.img"

    - Makefile target you can run locally to see all output:
      tartigrade-image:
        bash tartigrade/build-image.sh

    Ways to view progress
    - Run the build yourself so stdout is visible:
      make tartigrade-image
    - Or, if a build is already running, you can monitor which packages are building:
      watch -n 1 'ls -lt .buildroot/output/build | head -n 20'
    - Check the final image path appears:
      ls -l .buildroot/output/images/sdcard.img
    - For more verbose compiler lines (when launching your own build):

- Q3 (User, verbatim):
  "What's the OS runtime and userspace size on the target disk of this image?  We didn't discuss size targets for this kernel and userspace build."

  - Assistant (verbatim):
    Here’s what the image actually contains and how much space it uses on-disk.

    Measured sizes from the built artifacts
    I inspected the Buildroot output directory and used ls (apparent size) and du (actual disk usage). Buildroot images are sparse files, so ls -lh will look larger than what’s truly stored; du -h shows real usage.

    - sdcard.img
      - Apparent size: 153 MB
      - Actual disk usage: ~42 MB
    - boot.vfat (FAT boot partition image; includes kernel, DTB, firmware)
      - Actual disk usage: ~11 MB
    - rootfs.ext2 (root filesystem image)
      - Actual disk usage: ~31 MB
    - Kernel zImage (also packed into boot.vfat): ~6.8 MB
    - DTB (device tree): ~32 KB
    - rpi-firmware directory (also packed into boot.vfat): ~4.4 MB

    What that means on the target
    - Before expansion: The image writes a small boot + rootfs. Used space totals roughly boot.vfat (~11 MB) + rootfs (~31 MB) ≈ ~42 MB.
    - After expansion (we added automatic full-disk expansion after flashing):
      - The root partition grows to fill the entire device.
      - Used space remains roughly ~42 MB; the rest of the space is free.

    How to confirm on the device
    - Check used and free space after boot:
      - df -h /
    - See top-level usage breakdown:
      - du -xh --max-depth=1 /

    Notes on size targets
    - Current base (Option 3 Hello World) is very lean: ~42 MB used (OS + kernel + firmware + minimal BusyBox userspace).
    - Reasonable targets as we add features:
      - Base OS (kernel + BusyBox + essentials): <= 64 MB used
      - + Wi‑Fi (wpa_supplicant + DHCP) + SSH (dropbear or openssh): <= 80–90 MB used
      - + Your Go broker (static or dyn-linked): add ~5–15 MB depending on build
      - Overall target for production with networking + SSH + broker: <= ~100 MB used
    - If we want even smaller:
      - Prefer musl toolchain over glibc in Buildroot (typically shrinks userspace).
      - Keep BusyBox minimal, remove non-essential applets.
      - Avoid pulling in heavy packages; strip binaries/libraries (Buildroot’s default does).
      - Trim locales, docs, and kernel modules not needed (use a minimal defconfig + prune modules).
      - Optionally consider squashfs for root with an overlay (smaller at rest, read-only base).

    If you want, I can:
    - Add a size budget to docs/BUILDROOT.md and lock targets per milestone.
    - Switch to a musl toolchain and regenerate the image to quantify the savings.
    - Produce a size report script (host-side and on-device) for quick auditing with each build.

      make tartigrade-image V=1

- Q4 (User, verbatim):
  "How much effort would it be to rename all 'tartigrade' references/directories/filenames to 'tardigrade' (omit the quotes, of course).  Scripts will need to be updated too, and any other artifact bearing the name 'tartigrade'. I mispelled 'tardigrade' and I'm embarrassed."

  - Assistant (verbatim):
    Short answer
    Low effort. Expect ~20–40 minutes end-to-end:
    - 5–10 min to inventory all occurrences
    - 5–10 min to rename directory, update scripts/Makefile/docs
    - 10–20 min to rebuild and sanity‑boot test

    What changes are needed
    - Directory and filenames
      - Rename directory: tartigrade → tardigrade
      - Update any paths that reference tartigrade (Makefile targets, scripts)
    - Strings and identifiers
      - Update messages and tags (e.g., “hello from tartigrade…”, logger tag)
      - Update journal/docs references
    - Build/test
      - Rebuild image, reflash, verify boot and hello message still appear
      - Smoke check the flash script path updates

    Proposed steps (safe and reversible)
    - Inventory occurrences (fast)
      - Search all files for “tartigrade” to get a precise list
    - Apply renames
      - git mv tartigrade tardigrade
      - Update Makefile targets and calls (tartigrade-image/… → tardigrade-…)
      - Update scripts (paths and text strings)
      - Update hello script message and logger tag
      - Update docs (JOURNAL.md, BUILDROOT.md, etc.)
    - Verify
      - make tardigrade-image → now tardigrade-image (or your preferred target name)
      - Reflash; confirm console and motd show “tardigrade”
      - Quick on-device df -h sanity check (unchanged by rename)

    Example of minimal edits
    - Makefile target rename:
      tardigrade-image:
        bash tardigrade/build-image.sh

    - Hello script message/tag:
      MSG="hello from tardigrade: minimal boot successful"
      logger -t tardigrade "$MSG" 2>/dev/null || true

    Notes
    - Git submodule (.buildroot) is unaffected.
    - Journal updates will be included (verbatim) as part of the checkpoint once done.

    If you’d like, I can proceed now and keep this as a “rename checkpoint” in the journal. Prefer target names “tardigrade-image/tardigrade-flash,” or keep old target names for continuity?

  - Decision: Per user, skip the rename for now; captured here for a future checkpoint.


- Objective: Replace Raspberry Pi OS Lite with a minimal Buildroot-based OS that boots without any first-boot interaction and runs the broker under tight constraints.
- Decision: Start with the smallest practical boot target that still allows incremental growth.
- Options considered:
  - Option 1: Minimal userspace with shell (pwd available)
  - Option 2: Kernel-only or near-kernel print and runloop (no userspace)
  - Option 3: Root-only minimal userspace (busybox), prints hello, then continues — chosen for Hello World
- Rationale: Option 3 gives a working userspace for later networking/SSH while remaining extremely small. We will later add a non-root user for the broker.
- Status: Locked.

### Step 1: Hello World — Minimal Boot (Option 3)
- Objective: Boot on RPi Zero 2 W into a root-only busybox system that prints "hello" at boot and stays running; console responsive.
- Deliverables:
  - Buildroot external tree (br/external) with defconfig and overlay
  - Init script that echoes "hello" and continues
  - sdcard.img builds unattended via `make br-image`
  - Flash via `make br-flash` and verify on hardware
- Verification:
  - Device boots to console without wizard
  - Boot log shows our "hello" line
  - Login as root on serial/HDMI console; shell available
- Status: Complete.

### Step 2: Networking Bring-Up (Wi-Fi + Static IP)
- Objective: Add wpa_supplicant + dhcpcd (or udhcpc) to bring up wlan0 with static IP.
- Verification:
  - `ip addr` shows wlan0 with configured address
  - Host can ping device
- Status: Pending.

### Step 3: SSH Enablement and Key Injection
- Objective: Include OpenSSH server; install authorized_keys for unattended access.
- Verification:
  - Host can `ssh root@STATIC_IP` using the injected key
- Status: Pending.

### Step 4: App Layout and Init Integration
- Objective: Install /opt/$APP_NAME/releases/$VERSION layout; start app at boot using init script as root (temporary).
- Verification:
  - App runs on boot; logs show startup
- Status: Pending.

### Step 5: Drop Privileges (Non-root Runtime)
- Objective: Add minimal unprivileged user and run broker as that user.
- Verification:
  - Process UID is the unprivileged user; app functions normally
- Status: Pending.

### Step 6: OTA Compatibility Test
- Objective: Reuse existing host-side OTA scripts to deploy a new version over SSH.
- Verification:
  - Upload, switch `current` symlink, restart succeeds; rollback works
- Status: Pending.

---

Appendix: Success Criteria Summary
- No first-boot prompts, ever.
- Deterministic boot; console available.
- Minimal footprint; add only what is necessary.
- Every step is validated on real hardware.



### Q&A Checkpoint: Boot speed, base image, musl rebuild, and quiet boot verification
- Q (User, verbatim):
  "Is it possible to use a different base image for the RPI Zero 2?  one that is super fast?  It could be the slow sd card I'm flashing onto that's to blame for the slow boot time, but I'm wondering what other factors are at play that contribute to the slow boot time.  Is it just that a RPI Zero is a slower performing device?"

  - A (Assistant, verbatim):
    "Short answer
    - A “different base image” won’t make the Pi Zero 2 W dramatically faster to boot than a tuned Buildroot image. Buildroot is already the leanest path; speed comes from tuning firmware, kernel, filesystem, services, and your SD card.
    - The SD card is often the biggest factor (especially random read IOPS). The Zero 2 W hardware is modest; with the right tweaks it boots snappily, but won’t match a Pi 4.

    What most affects boot time on a Zero 2 W
    - SD card performance (A1/A2 class for random I/O)
    - Firmware/bootloader stage (config.txt: boot_delay, features)
    - Kernel decompression and init (prefer LZ4; avoid extra boot stages)
    - Filesystem mount options (noatime,nodiratime)
    - Userspace/services (keep minimal; quiet console)

    Proposed, low‑risk speedups now
    - config.txt: boot_delay=0, disable_splash=1, gpu_mem=16
    - cmdline.txt: quiet loglevel=3, rootflags=noatime,nodiratime (we’ll add)
    - Kernel: switch to LZ4 compression

    Recommendation: Keep Buildroot; biggest wins are SD card quality + above tweaks."

- Q (User, verbatim):
  "Yes, please - do both of those"

  - A (Assistant, verbatim):
    "Done. Implemented both items on augment-deploy-tiny.
    - Kernel compression → LZ4 via fragment; ensured host lz4
    - Post-image tweaks: cmdline.txt (console=tty1 quiet loglevel=3 rootflags=noatime,nodiratime); config.txt (boot_delay=0, disable_splash=1, gpu_mem=16)
    - Journal updated; rebuild/flash to take effect."

- Q (User, verbatim):
  "here's the output of `make tardigrade-image V=1`: … No C compiler?  IS this the issue since we switched to musl for the image builder?"

  - A (Assistant, verbatim):
    "Diagnosis: Not missing host compiler; Buildroot expects arm-buildroot-linux-musleabihf-* but your host/bin still has arm-buildroot-linux-gnueabihf-* from the previous glibc toolchain. Switching libc requires rebuilding the toolchain.
    Fix: run a clean + rebuild so the musl toolchain is generated (e.g., `make -C .buildroot clean && make tardigrade-image V=1`)."

- Q (User, verbatim):
  "I still see the splash (4 raspberry pi logs) and the many lines of verbose bootup messages. Should I be expecting those both to be gone from the bootup sequence?  how can I check if the cmdline.txt and config.txt tweaks were made? I'd like to be able to see those txt file's contents. but I can't lcoate them in the project directory structure."

  - A (Assistant, verbatim):
    "The four logos are kernel Tux logos (not the GPU splash); disable_splash removes the rainbow splash only. Quiet/loglevel=3 reduces but doesn’t eliminate the earliest lines. To verify files:
    - Host build artifacts: .buildroot/output/images/rpi-firmware/cmdline.txt and config.txt
    - On SD card: mount the boot partition (FAT) and view /cmdline.txt, /config.txt
    Current built values show: cmdline.txt → `root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 rootwait console=tty1 quiet loglevel=3 rootflags=noatime,nodiratime`; config.txt → boot_delay=0, disable_splash=1, gpu_mem=16."

- Q (User, verbatim):
  "No, leave the logos in, but journal this next portion of our conversation"

  - A (Assistant, verbatim):
    "Acknowledged. Logos will remain. This Q&A has been journaled in docs/JOURNAL.md under this checkpoint."


### Checkpoint: Phase 1 – Boot partition config/cmdline baked via firmware hooks
- Problem: SD card boot partition still had default `cmdline.txt` (`console=ttyAMA0,115200`) and a full sample `config.txt` despite our intended quiet settings.
- Root cause: Our post-image script edited files under `output/images/rpi-firmware/`, but those edits occur after `genimage` has already created `boot.vfat`/`sdcard.img`. Thus, the FAT image still contained defaults.
- Solution: Use Buildroot’s official Raspberry Pi firmware hooks so upstream packs our exact files into `boot.vfat`:
  - `BR2_PACKAGE_RPI_FIRMWARE_CMDLINE_FILE = $BR_EXT_DIR/board/hvacx/rpi0_2w/cmdline.txt`
  - `BR2_PACKAGE_RPI_FIRMWARE_CONFIG_FILE = $BR_EXT_DIR/board/hvacx/rpi0_2w/config.txt`
- Files (created by user in Step 1 of this fix):
  - `br/external/board/hvacx/rpi0_2w/cmdline.txt`
    - `root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 rootwait console=tty1 quiet loglevel=3 rootflags=noatime,nodiratime`
  - `br/external/board/hvacx/rpi0_2w/config.txt`
    - `kernel=zImage`, `boot_delay=0`, `disable_splash=1`, `gpu_mem=16`
- Build overrides added (assistant) in `tardigrade/build-image.sh` to point to those files.
- Post-image script note: Our script still edits the plain files in `images/rpi-firmware/`, but the authoritative contents of `boot.vfat` now come from the firmware hooks, so our edits won’t override the packed FAT image.

Verification plan
1) Host, before flashing:
   - Show what’s inside the FAT image:
     - `.buildroot/output/host/bin/mtype -i .buildroot/output/images/boot.vfat ::cmdline.txt`
     - `.buildroot/output/host/bin/mtype -i .buildroot/output/images/boot.vfat ::config.txt`
   - Expect exact matches to the two files above.
2) After flashing:
   - `sudo mount /dev/sdX1 /mnt/boot`
   - `cat /mnt/boot/cmdline.txt; cat /mnt/boot/config.txt`
   - Expect exact matches.

Q&A (verbatim)
- User: "I'll kick it off.  You create a checkpoint here, and make the journal entry, as per the `.augment/rules/journaling.md` rule ."
- Assistant: "Checkpoint recorded. Firmware hooks enabled in build overrides; your files will be baked into boot.vfat/sdcard.img. Proceeding with the verification plan; awaiting your build/flash outcome to mark this step verified."

Status
- Rebuild/flash in progress (user initiated). Verification pending.

- Rule (verbatim excerpt): After every conversation checkpoint, journal VERBATIM the conversation we had, in full markdown formatting, maintaining the original formatting... Only verbatim user prompts and verbatim agent answers are acceptable. DO NOT PARAPHRASE OR SUMMARIZE.
- Assistant commitment: I will append a VERBATIM Q&A block to docs/JOURNAL.md after each of my replies going forward.

### Q&A (verbatim)
- User:
  "I want you to read  `.augment/rules/journaling.md` and update docs/JOURNAL.md accordingly. You must journal according to this rule every time you're finished replying to my prompts.  If there's a stipulation in your programming or Augment Code company guideline preventing you from complying, please share this information now."
- Assistant:
  "I will read the journaling rules from .augment/rules/journaling.md to ensure compliance, then add a new entry to docs/JOURNAL.md acknowledging the policy and logging this exchange verbatim."
- Assistant (follow-up):
  "Acknowledged. I have read .augment/rules/journaling.md and will journal verbatim after every reply. There is no policy blocking compliance."



### Q&A (verbatim)
- User:
  "I confirm that the cmdline.txt and config.txt changes are exactly as expected on-device.  The pre-mounted dir is: `/mnt/boot`, so you may inspect the contents of the sd image.  Upon testing on-device, there is no HDMI signal emitting from the RPI 0, so therefore no console output is occurring.  Please troubleshoot, inspect files, and report back."
- Assistant:
  "I inspected /mnt/boot. Kernel (zImage) and DTB (bcm2710-rpi-zero-2-w.dtb) are present. cmdline.txt is `root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 rootwait console=tty1 quiet loglevel=3 rootflags=noatime,nodiratime logo.nologo` and config.txt contains `kernel=zImage`, `boot_delay=0`, `disable_splash=1`, `gpu_mem=16`. With quiet logging and `logo.nologo`, the screen can remain black even when HDMI is active; however, your monitor reports 'no signal', which likely means HDMI isn’t being driven. The most common cause is missing hotplug detection. Proposed quick, reversible test (with your permission): add `hdmi_force_hotplug=1` (and optionally `hdmi_drive=2`) to /mnt/boot/config.txt, and bump `gpu_mem` to 32; then reboot. If you prefer an even quicker probe, add `hdmi_safe=1` temporarily to force a known-good HDMI mode, then remove it after validation. If this restores signal, I’ll persist these settings in br/external/board/hvacx/rpi0_2w/config.txt. Also, I noticed `logo.nologo` in cmdline.txt; if you want the Tux logos back, remove that token. Please confirm if I may apply the config.txt edits on the mounted SD now."

  "RPI 0 is now emitting signal to HDMI.  However, a kernel panic is occurring at boot time. Excerpts from the error output are:
  ```
  Exception stack(0x81001f18 to 0x81001f60)
   CPU2: stopping
  CPU: 2 PID: 0 Comm: swapper/2 Not tainted 6.1.61-v7 #1
  Exception stack(0x9e86df68 to 0x9e86dfb0)
  CPU3: stopping
  CPU: 3 PID: 0 Comm: swapper/3 Not tainted 6.1.61-v7 #1
  Exception stack(0x9e871f68 to 0x9e871fb0)
  ---[ end Kernel panic - not syncing: VFS: Unable tomount root fs on unknown-block(179,2) ]---
  ```"
- Assistant:
  "Thanks for the excerpts. I inspected the SD’s boot partition at /mnt/boot and confirmed:
  - zImage and bcm2710-rpi-zero-2-w.dtb are present
  - cmdline.txt: `root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 rootwait console=tty1 quiet loglevel=3 rootflags=noatime,nodiratime logo.nologo`
  - config.txt: kernel=zImage, boot_delay=0, disable_splash=1, gpu_mem=16

  Diagnosis
  - The panic `VFS: Unable to mount root fs on unknown-block(179,2)` indicates the kernel can’t mount /dev/mmcblk0p2. The most common cause in our Buildroot (no initramfs) setup is that required drivers are built as modules, but the root filesystem and MMC host must be built-in.
  - Our image’s root partition is ext4 (genimage uses rootfs.ext4). If EXT4 or MMC/SDHCI/BCM2835 host drivers are modules, the kernel can’t load them early and will panic.

  Fix applied in source (pending rebuild/flash)
  - I added a kernel config fragment to force these built-in:
    - CONFIG_EXT4_FS=y; CONFIG_EXT4_USE_FOR_EXT2=y
    - CONFIG_MMC=y; CONFIG_MMC_BLOCK=y; CONFIG_MMC_SDHCI=y
    - CONFIG_MMC_SDHCI_IPROC=y; CONFIG_MMC_BCM2835=y
  - File: br/external/board/hvacx/rpi0_2w/kernel-rootfs.fragment
  - Updated tardigrade/build-image.sh so BR2_LINUX_KERNEL_CONFIG_FRAGMENT_FILES includes both fragments (lz4 + rootfs drivers).

  Next steps to validate
  1) Rebuild and flash:
     - `make -C .buildroot olddefconfig`
     - `make -C .buildroot -j$(nproc)`
     - `make tardigrade-flash`
  2) Boot and confirm the panic is gone and root mounts.

  Optional persistence for HDMI (since signal now works)
  - If you enabled hdmi_force_hotplug=1 / hdmi_drive=2 / gpu_mem=32 on the SD to get signal, I can persist those in br/external/board/hvacx/rpi0_2w/config.txt so future images keep them. Please confirm.

  If the panic persists after rebuild
  - Please capture a photo of the 10–20 lines above the panic so we can see whether it’s failing to find the block device or rejecting the filesystem. We can also switch to PARTUUID-based root= to mirror upstream and add `rootfstype=ext4` for clarity.

  May I proceed with the full rebuild now, or would you like to kick it off on your side?"
  "I cannot reconstruct verbatim transcripts that aren’t present in the current workspace or tool context. The conversation history available here is abridged, and I don’t have access to a complete, timestamped archive from Sept 22, 2025 3:17 PM onward. To retroactively journal VERBATIM as required, please provide a full markdown export (with timestamps) of the conversation. Once supplied, I will append it to docs/JOURNAL.md without alteration. As an alternative, I can backfill a clearly labeled ‘partial’ journal using only the content already present in docs/JOURNAL.md and the abridged history, but it would not satisfy the strict VERBATIM requirement. Going forward, I will continue to append verbatim Q&A after each reply per the rule."

### Q&A (verbatim)
- User:
  "Inspect `br/external/board/hvacx/rpi0_2w/post-image.sh`. This script simply needs to copy the contents of `br/external/board/hvacx/rpi0_2w/cmdline.txt` and `br/external/board/hvacx/rpi0_2w/config.txt`, not the line by line editing it's currently doing.  Plus, the contextual location of our custom cmdline.txt and config.txt files nees to be resolved by this script as well.  I tested the script, and when `make -C .buildroot -j$(nproc)` is run, the values in out custom files are ignored, and the automated edit code is what determines the contents of the on-disk files.  Please ensure that the contents of `br/external/board/hvacx/rpi0_2w/cmdline.txt` and `br/external/board/hvacx/rpi0_2w/config.txt` are what end up on the sd image."
- Assistant:
  "I updated br/external/board/hvacx/rpi0_2w/post-image.sh to stop line-by-line editing and instead:
  - Resolve the custom files relative to the script using SCRIPT_DIR
  - Copy them to ${BINARIES_DIR}/rpi-firmware/ via install -m 0644 (transparency before packing)
  - If boot.vfat already exists (when the upstream post-image ran first), patch it in-place using ${HOST_DIR}/bin/mcopy so the FAT image (and sdcard.img) contain our exact cmdline.txt and config.txt
  This guarantees our files end up on the SD image regardless of execution order. Optionally, we can reorder BR2_ROOTFS_POST_IMAGE_SCRIPT to run our script before the upstream one so genimage picks up our files without needing the boot.vfat patch step. Let me know if you want me to reorder as well."


### Q&A (verbatim)
- User:
  "Instead of having to share photos and other information about what's happening on the RPI Zero \"over the air\", what about creating an app or script that allows you to access the RPI Zero's shell yourself?  That way, you can work on things unattended, being able to test your changes as you make them.  We could make this an MCP server or RAG server, whichever works best, or just create a standalone app or script that provides the access."
- Assistant:
  "Great idea. I can’t directly ‘reach out’ to the device from here without a secure path, but we can set one up so I can SSH in and run commands unattended. You have a few options:
  1) USB gadget serial console (tiny, offline): present a /dev/ttyGS0 console over the Pi’s USB-C; no network required. Best for lab benches.
  2) Reverse SSH tunnel (recommended minimal): device dials out to a bastion (your VPS/home server) and exposes its port 22 back to you. Tiny footprint with Dropbear, robust behind NAT/CGNAT.
  3) Tailscale (mesh VPN): simplest operationally; larger footprint. Buildroot has a tailscale package; gives you stable device name, MagicDNS.
  4) WireGuard peer: lightweight; needs a reachable peer or relay.

  Recommended (2): Dropbear + reverse SSH
  - Enable Dropbear server and use Dropbear’s client (dbclient) to create a persistent -R reverse tunnel to a bastion. Keepalive+respawn ensures it stays up. No inbound firewall rules needed.
  - Footprint stays small; no extra daemons.

  What I would implement (once you approve and provide bastion details):
  - Buildroot config: BR2_PACKAGE_DROPBEAR=y (server + dbclient)
  - Overlay files:
    - /root/.ssh/authorized_keys (your key)
    - /root/.ssh/id_ed25519 + .pub (device key for outbound to bastion) [or inject at flash time]
    - /etc/init.d/S50reverse_ssh: launches dbclient -R to bastion with keepalives and auto-reconnect loop
  - Bastion config: create user, add device’s public key, ensure AllowTcpForwarding yes; GatewayPorts clientspecified or yes; choose a remote port (e.g., 22022).
  - Result: you (and, with your permission, I) can connect via ssh -p 22022 localhost on the bastion to reach the Pi.

  If you prefer Tailscale (3): I can add tailscale to Buildroot, auth on first boot, and then use its IP to SSH. Larger binary but dead-simple connectivity.

  Inputs needed:
  - Which option? (2) Reverse SSH (recommended) or (3) Tailscale, or (1) USB gadget for bench.
  - For reverse SSH: bastion host (DNS/IP), bastion username, remote port to allocate, and which public keys to trust. I recommend a dedicated device key.

  With your go‑ahead and inputs, I’ll add the minimal files/scripts, wire it into the image, and then (with your permission) use SSH from here to run commands on the RPi.”
