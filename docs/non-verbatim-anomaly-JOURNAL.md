  "Inspect `br/external/board/hvacx/rpi0_2w/post-image.sh`. This script simply needs to copy the contents of `br/external/board/hvacx/rpi0_2w/cmdline.txt` and `br/external/board/hvacx/rpi0_2w/config.txt`, not the line by line editing it's currently doing.  Plus, the contextual location of our custom cmdline.txt and config.txt files nees to be resolved by this script as well.  I tested the script, and when `make -C .buildroot -j$(nproc)` is run, the values in out custom files are ignored, and the automated edit code is what determines the contents of the on-disk files.  Please ensure that the contents of `br/external/board/hvacx/rpi0_2w/cmdline.txt` and `br/external/board/hvacx/rpi0_2w/config.txt` are what end up on the sd image."

  "I updated br/external/board/hvacx/rpi0_2w/post-image.sh to stop line-by-line editing and instead:
  - Resolve the custom files relative to the script using SCRIPT_DIR
  - Copy them to ${BINARIES_DIR}/rpi-firmware/ via install -m 0644 (transparency before packing)
  - If boot.vfat already exists (when the upstream post-image ran first), patch it in-place using ${HOST_DIR}/bin/mcopy so the FAT image (and sdcard.img) contain our exact cmdline.txt and config.txt
  This guarantees our files end up on the SD image regardless of execution order. Optionally, we can reorder BR2_ROOTFS_POST_IMAGE_SCRIPT to run our script before the upstream one so genimage picks up our files without needing the boot.vfat patch step. Let me know if you want me to reorder as well."

  "Instead of having to share photos and other information about what's happening on the RPI Zero \"over the air\", what about creating an app or script that allows you to access the RPI Zero's shell yourself?  That way, you can work on things unattended, being able to test your changes as you make them.  We could make this an MCP server or RAG server, whichever works best, or just create a standalone app or script that provides the access."

  "Great idea. I can’t directly ‘reach out’ to the device from here without a secure path, but we can set one up so I can SSH in and run commands unattended. You have a few options:
  1) USB gadget serial console (tiny, offline): present a /dev/ttyGS0 console over the Pi’s USB-C; no network required. Best for lab benches.
  2) Reverse SSH tunnel (recommended minimal): device dials out to a bastion (your VPS/home server) and exposes its port 22 back to you. Tiny footprint with Dropbear, robust behind NAT/CGNAT.
  3) Tailscale (mesh VPN): simplest operationally; larger footprint. Buildroot has a tailscale package; gives you stable device name, MagicDNS.
  4) WireGuard peer: lightweight; needs a reachable peer or relay.

  Recommended (2): Dropbear + reverse SSH
  - Enable Dropbear server and use Dropbear’s client (dbclient) to create a persistent -R reverse tunnel to a bastion. Keepalive+respawn ensures it stays up. No inbound firewall rules needed.
  - Footprint stays small; no extra daemons.

  What I would implement (once you approve and provide bastion details):
  - Buildroot config: BR2_PACKAGE_DROPBEAR=y (server + dbclient)
  - Overlay files:
    - /root/.ssh/authorized_keys (your key)
    - /root/.ssh/id_ed25519 + .pub (device key for outbound to bastion) [or inject at flash time]
    - /etc/init.d/S50reverse_ssh: launches dbclient -R to bastion with keepalives and auto-reconnect loop
  - Bastion config: create user, add device’s public key, ensure AllowTcpForwarding yes; GatewayPorts clientspecified or yes; choose a remote port (e.g., 22022).
  - Result: you (and, with your permission, I) can connect via ssh -p 22022 localhost on the bastion to reach the Pi.

  If you prefer Tailscale (3): I can add tailscale to Buildroot, auth on first boot, and then use its IP to SSH. Larger binary but dead-simple connectivity.

  Inputs needed:
  - Which option? (2) Reverse SSH (recommended) or (3) Tailscale, or (1) USB gadget for bench.
  - For reverse SSH: bastion host (DNS/IP), bastion username, remote port to allocate, and which public keys to trust. I recommend a dedicated device key.

  With your go‑ahead and inputs, I’ll add the minimal files/scripts, wire it into the image, and then (with your permission) use SSH from here to run commands on the RPi.”
