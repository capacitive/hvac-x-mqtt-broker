### Minimal Image Deployment & Subsequent OTA Deployment
1. Make sure the OTA deploy system is congruent with the minimal OS image configuration - I can see that the setup-pi.sh script may be overlapping some of the items already completed in the create-complete-image.sh script. The goal is to use the min OS image script to make the image, then use the flash-usb.sh script to flash it onto the SD drive for the RPI Zero, then use the OTA deployment command in the makefile to continuously deploy to the RPI Zero.
2. Make both the OTA and min image scripts available via makefile commands.  The OTA may not need the pi setup, since the flashed image already has things like the /opt/hvac-mqtt directory.  Make sure to include all the things required for the mqtt-broker app to run at device startup.

### Logging
1. All log output of the mqtt-broker is required to stream to the shell prompt of the minimal linux OS running on the RPI Zero, for all users. Tail the last 20 outputs - only those need be printed on the screen at one time.
2. All log output is required to be streamed to a web socket for remote monitoring and debugging.  Also provide a gRPC endpoint for remote log output monitoring and debugging.
