I&#39;m being presented with a demand to enter a new username for the RPI OS. I want all OS setup interactions to be removed - the image is not producing a true headless server experience yet, with all configurations completed before flashing to the SD card.

---

The Pi Zero is prompting for user setup because the minimal OS lacks proper user configuration. I'll fix this by pre-configuring a root user and disabling the setup wizard.

---

Add pre-configured root user and disable setup wizard to create truly headless experience

---

Replace auto-login configuration to use root user and disable user setup wizard

---

Update configuration summary to reflect root user setup

---


The image now configures:

**Root Auto-login:** Pi boots directly to root shell with no user prompts
**Pre-configured Users:** Creates pi user to satisfy Pi OS requirements but uses root for auto-login
**Disabled Setup Wizard:** Prevents any user configuration prompts
**Service User:** MQTT broker runs as root for full system access

The Pi Zero will now boot directly to a root shell with your MQTT broker running automatically - no user interaction required.

WIFI SSID selection default:
`starcaf`

---

Set default WiFi SSID to 'starcaf'

---


WiFi SSID now defaults to 'starcaf' - just press Enter to use the default or type a different network name.

---

Wifi password: show asterisk for each character entered, to support better user interaction feedback

---

Add asterisk feedback for WiFi password input

---


WiFi password input now shows asterisks (*) for each character typed and supports backspace to delete characters with visual feedback.

---

Add an updating progress bar to the USB flash script output.

---

Add progress bar to dd command using status=progress

---

Add progress bar with pv command for better visual feedback

---


The flash script now shows a progress bar using `pv` (pipe viewer) if available, which provides a visual progress bar with transfer rate and ETA. Falls back to `dd status=progress` if `pv` is not installed.

---

Include `pv` installation in the USB flash script.

---

Install pv if not available for progress bar functionality

---


The script now automatically installs `pv` if not present, ensuring the progress bar always works.
