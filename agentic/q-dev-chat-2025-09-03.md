I'll help you create a test app that emulates a sail-sensor's behavior. Let me start by examining the existing code to understand the broker's structure and event handling.

---


Now let me examine the project structure to understand the module setup:

---


Let me also check the config package to understand the structure:

---


Perfect! Now I understand the broker's structure. Let me analyze what I've learned:

## Analysis of the Existing Broker

From examining the code, I can see:

1. **MQTT Topic Structure**: The broker subscribes to `starcaf/contrl/sensor/hvac/sail/attributes` (lines 57-58)
2. **Payload Format**: The sensor sends JSON with a `fan-sensor` field that can be "ON" or "OFF" (line 89)
3. **Event Handlers**: The broker has OnConnect, OnDisconnect, OnClientExpired handlers
4. **Device Control**: When sensor state changes, it publishes commands to plugs using the format from config

Now I'll create a minimal test app that emulates a sail-sensor with the two modes you requested:

---

Creating the test sensor application that emulates sail-sensor behavior with manual and auto modes

---

Creating the test-sensor directory first

---

shell

---

You stopped your current work and asked me to work on the following task instead.

---

Instead of created the &#39;test-sensor&#39; directory, rename the &#39;utility-app&#39; directory to &#39;test-sensor&#39; and make use of the isolated dependency structure it contains. I want the test-sensor to be a standalone app, and not touch the hvac-x-mqtt-broker go.mod

---

Let me first check the existing directory structure to see the utility-app:

---

Perfect! Let me examine the utility-app structure first:

---

Now I'll rename the directory and replace the content with the test sensor app:

---

Renaming utility-app directory to test-sensor

---

shell

---

Now I'll update the go.mod file and create the test sensor application:

---

Updating go.mod to use MQTT client library instead of Gin

---

Replacing the main.go with the test sensor application that emulates sail-sensor behavior

---

Now let me update the dependencies and build the application:

---

Downloading dependencies for the test sensor

---

shell

---

Building the test sensor application

---

shell

---

I need to update the go.work file to reflect the directory rename:

---

Updating go.work to reference the renamed test-sensor directory

---

Building the test sensor application again

---

shell

---

Perfect! Now let me create a simple README to explain how to use the test sensor:

---

Creating documentation for the test sensor application

---


## Summary

I've successfully created a minimal test sensor application by:

1. **Renamed** `utility-app` to `test-sensor` and updated the workspace configuration
2. **Replaced** the Gin HTTP server with an MQTT client that emulates sail-sensor behavior
3. **Implemented** the exact topic and payload format used by the broker (`starcaf/contrl/sensor/hvac/sail/attributes` with `{"fan-sensor": "ON|OFF"}`)
4. **Added two modes**:
   - **Manual mode**: Commands `on`/`off` for direct control
   - **Auto mode**: Command `auto` toggles rapid succession (100ms intervals) to test broker's handling of rapid-fire events

The test app is standalone with its own `go.mod` and connects to `localhost:1883` to interact with your broker. It covers all the event scenarios you mentioned and will help test the broker's event handler improvements for ignoring rapid-fire events and acting only on stable states.

when connecting to 192.168.1.23:1881, this is the error in the connection response:

network Error : dial tcp 192.168.1.23:1883: connect: no route to host

when connecting to 192.168.1.23:1883 (as per configuration in env variable), this is the error in the connection response:

network Error : dial tcp 192.168.1.23:1883: connect: no route to host

---

Correcting the port back to 1883 as specified by user

---


The "no route to host" error indicates a network connectivity issue. The broker at 192.168.1.23:1883 is either:

1. Not running
2. Firewall blocking the connection
3. Network routing issue

Try:
- `ping 192.168.1.23` to test basic connectivity
- `telnet 192.168.1.23 1883` to test port accessibility
- Use `BROKER_URL=tcp://localhost:1883` if broker is local
