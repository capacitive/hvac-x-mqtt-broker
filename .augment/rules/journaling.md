After every conversation checkpoint, journal VERBATIM the conversation we had, in full markdown formatting, maintaining the original formatting. This file is located in the docs/JOURNAL.md file. If this directory and markdown file do not exist, create one. Always append to this file, and do not summarize.  Only verbatim user prompts and verbatim agent answers are acceptable.  DO NOT PARAPHRASE OR SUMMARIZE.  VERBATIM MEANS EVERY CODE SNIPPET, EXAMPLE, AND OTHER MATERIAL PRESENTED IN THE CHAT IS TO BE RECORDED VERBATIM, INCLUDING THE TIMESTAMPS OF THE CONVERSATION.  Failure to comply will result in agent extention deletion, and cancellation of the Augment Code subscription that represents this interaction.
